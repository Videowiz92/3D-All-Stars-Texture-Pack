3D-ALL-STARS-TEXTURE-PACK
--------------------------
This pack includes all source textures that were upgraded by Nintendo for Super Mario 3D All Stars.

Installation Instructions:
--------------------------
Unpack the .zip into your sm64ex-coop folder >> dynos >> packs
The folder structure should be "dynos\packs\3D All Stars Texture Pack 1.0\...#.tex files and folders"
Launch SM64 Coop and go to Options >> DynOS Packs (refresh might be needed)

Known Issues:
--------------------------
This pack was tested on [Super Mario 64 Coop Deluxe](https://github.com/coop-deluxe/sm64coopdx) v36.1

As the source textures only exist for Mario, there are no upgrades to other characters.
The M Logo on Mario's hat doesn't upgrade* - if anyone can figure out how to fix this, please let me know.
The outro cake screen does not work* - I can't figure out what to name the .png files to render them in-game
*Both Mario's hat and the outro cake screen source textures are included in folders.
